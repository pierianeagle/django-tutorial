# Polls

Polls is a Django app to conduct web-based polls. For each question,
visitors can choose between a fixed number of answers.

Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.

## Quick start

1. Add "polls" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'polls',
    ]
    ```

2. Include the polls URLconf in your project urls.py like this:

    ```python
    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
    ```

3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the polls models.

4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to create a poll (you'll need the Admin app enabled).

5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/ to participate in the poll.
